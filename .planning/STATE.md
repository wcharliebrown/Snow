# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-27)

**Core value:** Any table in the database can be managed through a consistent, ACL-controlled admin interface with full versioning and rollback — without writing boilerplate for each new table.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Security Foundations

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Security Foundations)
Plan: 3 of TBD in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-02-28 — Plan 01-03 complete: Password policy functions and enforcement hooks implemented

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 15%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 9.3 min
- Total execution time: 0.47 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-security-foundations | 3 | 28 min | 9.3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (20 min), 01-02 (5 min), 01-03 (3 min)
- Trend: Accelerating

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 5 phases derived from dependency graph — sessions before ACL, ACL before versioning, hooks before 2FA
- Research: Phase 3 (snapshot restore) and Phase 4 (TOTP) flagged for deeper research during planning; Phases 1, 2, 5 have standard patterns, skip research
- Security: Audit custom table provisioner column name validation in Phase 1 (PITFALL-A06 — already shipped code)
- DB schema (01-01): ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is MariaDB-only syntax — MySQL 8.0 requires PREPARE/EXECUTE conditional guard via INFORMATION_SCHEMA check
- DB schema (01-01): LONGTEXT/TEXT/BLOB columns cannot have DEFAULT values in MySQL 8.0 strict mode
- DB schema (01-01): Docker stack started as part of plan execution; .env created from .env.example with docker-compose credentials
- Sessions (01-02): read() returns '' (not false) for new sessions — PHP SessionHandlerInterface requires empty string to indicate new session vs error
- Sessions (01-02): SELECT FOR UPDATE used inside a transaction in read(); write() commits it — ensures concurrent request serialization
- Sessions (01-02): logging.php and database.php moved above session registration in initializeFramework() so SnowSessionHandler has PDO at construction
- Sessions (01-02): sessions.user_id updated via separate UPDATE in loginUser() after authentication — write() runs before user identity is known
- [Phase 01-03]: NULL password_changed_at treated as not-expired for backward compat with existing users
- [Phase 01-03]: changePassword() returns array of error strings (not false) so callers can display specific validation messages
- [Phase 01-03]: minlength HTML attribute uses getPasswordPolicy() dynamically so browser validation matches server-side policy

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Existing custom table provisioner may have schema injection vulnerability (PITFALL-A06) — audit is part of Phase 1 scope
- Phase 3: Snapshot restore path has schema-drift edge cases (columns added/removed after snapshot taken) — resolve during Phase 3 planning
- Phase 4: TOTP was deferred from v1 (SEC-05 uses email OTP only); TOTP (AUTH-V2-01) is v2

## Session Continuity
